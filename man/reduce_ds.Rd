\title{Reduce a list of mrgsimsds objects into a single object}
\usage{
reduce_ds(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a list of mrgsimsds objects or a single mrgsimsds object.}

\item{...}{not used.}
}
\value{
A single mrgsimsds object. For the list method, the returned object
will own all underlying files.
}
\description{
Reduce a list of mrgsimsds objects into a single object
}
\details{
When \code{x} is a list, a new object is created and returned. This new object
will take ownership for all the files from the objects in the list.

When \code{x} is an mrgsimsds object, it will be returned invisibly with no
modification.

  out <- mrgsim_ds(mod, data) 
  out
})
