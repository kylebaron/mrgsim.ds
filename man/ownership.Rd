\title{Ownership of simulation files}
\usage{
ownership()

list_ownership(full.names = FALSE)

check_ownership(x)

disown(x)

take_ownership(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{full.names}{if \code{TRUE}, include the directory path when listing file
ownership.}

\item{x}{an mrgsimsds object.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{check_ownership}: \code{TRUE} if \code{x} owns the underlying files; \code{FALSE}
otherwise.
\item \code{list_ownership}: a data.frame of ownership information.
\item \code{ownership}: nothing; used for side effects.
\item \code{disown}: \code{x} is returned invisibly; it is not modified.
\item \code{take_ownership}: \code{x} is returned invisibly after getting modified in
place.

\description{
Functions to check ownership or disown simulation output files on disk.
}
\details{
One situation were you need to take over ownership is when you are simulating
in parallel, and the simulation happens in another R process. \code{mrgsim.ds}
ownership is established when the simulation returns and the \code{mrgsimsds}
object is created. When this happens in another R process (e.g., on a
worker node, there is no way to transfer that information back to the
parent process. In that case, a call to \code{take_ownership()} once the results
are returned to the parent process would be appropriate. Typically, these
results are returned as a list and a call to \code{\link[=reduce_ds]{reduce_ds()}} will create
a single object pointing to and owning multiple files. Therefore, it should
be rare to call \code{take_ownership()} directly; if doing so, please make sure
you understand what is going on.

e1 <- ev(amt = 100)
